    <p style="color: rgb(183, 191, 198);" align="center">The 2025 Edutrip activity took place from March 8th to March 15th, 2025, during which I had the incredible opportunity to visit several remarkable cities across Taiwan, including Taoyuan, Hualien, Taipei, and Keelung. Each of these destinations offered unique experiences that enriched my understanding of Taiwan’s diverse culture, advanced technology, and stunning natural beauty. Among these cities, I was particularly captivated by Hualien, a scenic county located on the eastern coast of Taiwan. Hualien is renowned for its breathtaking natural landscapes, rich indigenous culture, and relaxed atmosphere, making it one of Taiwan’s most popular tourist destinations. The region boasts stunning coastal views, towering mountains, and lush valleys that left me in awe of its pristine beauty. During my time there, I had the chance to witness many of Taiwan’s most beautiful landscapes, immerse myself in its vibrant culture, admire its artistic expressions, and explore its technological innovations, among countless other unforgettable experiences.</p>
    <p style="color: rgb(183, 191, 198)" align="center">The Edutrip was not only super fun but also immensely educational, as I had the privilege of learning many new things about Taiwan. I delved into the country’s fascinating history, observed its highly efficient recycling system, and marveled at its amazing architecture, which seamlessly blends traditional designs with modern advancements. Every moment of the trip was filled with discovery, whether I was hiking through majestic national parks, interacting with local communities, or visiting cutting-edge institutions that showcased Taiwan’s progress in science and sustainability. Each section of the navigation bar on this website will provide further information and details about the things I learned, saw, and did during the Edutrip, allowing you to explore the highlights of this incredible journey at your own pace. From the bustling streets of Taipei to the serene shores of Hualien, every destination contributed to a deeper appreciation of Taiwan’s unique charm and global significance. I invite you to navigate through the sections and join me in reliving the memories and insights gained from this extraordinary adventure. This site is your guide to everything I learned, saw, and experienced during my Edutrip! Use the navigation bar to explore more.</p>
